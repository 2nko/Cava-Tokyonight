# Tokyonight theme for cava
This repo contains the [Tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) theme for cava!

## How do i apply this??
1. Open the theme you want from [themes](themes) and copy it's contents
2. Open in your system the file ```~/.config/cava/config``` with your favourite editor and go down to whwere it says ```[color]```
3. Delete the color section and ONLY THE COLOR SECTION (stop at smoothing)
4. Paste what you copied from step 1 and make sure you save before exiting
5. Enjoy!

## Help, the background is weird
If you are usign ur terminal with blur or anything you might see on cava a solid color background instead of being blurred with x opacity.
To fix this simply go to ```[color]``` and where it says ```background``` and add a ; in the begining 

## Where do i find Moon, Storm and/or Day variant :(
so uhh, i haven't done them yet... you will have to wait a bit
